To know which fields identify individual resources in your schema the GBox needs to know which field holds the unique identifier for a certain node type.
This is mainly used for invalidate changed results from the cache store, either via automatic cache invalidation or the admin API.

By default, the GBox looks for `id` field on your types. However, sometimes you have other unique fields (like e.g. User.email).

Declaring type keys
-------------------

The GBox use [Caddyfile syntax](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/concepts#structure) to declaring type keys via `GBOX_CACHING_TYPE_KEYS` environment variable.

```yaml
GBOX_CACHING_TYPE_KEYS: |
  User email # Directive will be use as a type and next args are field keys.
```

Now you can invalidate cached query results via admin purging api:

```graphql
mutation {
    purgeTypeKey(type: "User", field: "email", key: "cached email")
}
```
