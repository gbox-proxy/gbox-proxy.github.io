The GBox provides a custom admin GraphQL API (a.k.a.Purging cache API), allows you to invalidate cached data.

Admin Endpoints
---------------

+ GraphQL playground available at path `/admin`
+ GraphQL API available at path `/admin/graphql`

Authentication
--------------

Everyone can access the admin GraphQL API, but you can enable basic auth for it. To enable basic auth you must set value of `GBOX_ENABLED_ADMIN_AUTH` environment variable to `true`.

Default basic auth username's `gbox` and password's `gbox` too, you can change them via `GBOX_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `GBOX_ADMIN_PASSWORD` envs, the password must be base64 encrypted with `bcrypt` algorithm.

:::tip
You can use [gbox hash-password](https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line#caddy-hash-password) cmd to generate the admin password.

Purging cached data
-------------------

Now you could try to use admin GraphQL api to purge cached data.

### Purge via an operation name

With this mutation, you can purge all cached results of the query with the operation name you provide.

```graphql
type Mutation {
    purgeOperation(name: String!): Boolean!
}
```

For example, to invalidate all results of queries named `getUsers`.

```graphql
mutation {
    purgeOperation(name: "getUsers")
}
```

### Purge via specific type

With this mutation, you can purge all cached results contain fields have specific type given.

```graphql
type Mutation {
    purgeType(type: String!): Boolean!
}
```

For example, to invalidate all results contain fields have `User` type.

```graphql
mutation {
    purgeType(type: "User")
}
```

### Purge via query root field

With this mutation, you can purge all cached results contain query root field given.

```graphql
type Mutation {
    purgeQueryRootField(field: String!): Boolean!
}
```

For example, to invalidate all results contain query root field `users`.

```graphql
mutation {
    purgeQueryRootField(field: "users")
}
```

### Purge via type key

If you want to purge an arbitrary type, limited by specific type key you can pass in as an argument.

```graphql
type Mutation {
    purgeTypeKey(
        type: String!
        field: String!
        key: String!
    ): Boolean
}
```

For example to either purge all cached query results have `User` type identified by the key field `email` with value `email@example.org` run the following mutations:

```graphql
mutation {
  purgeTypeKey(type: "User", field: "email", key: "email@example.org")
}
```
