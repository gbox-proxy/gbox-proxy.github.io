Some types and fields can contain data that is specific to a certain user. Cached query results that contain those types (or fields) should not be returned to any other user.

To handle this scenario, you can define `varies` for GBox which let you scope (hence the name) cached query results to specific headers and/or cookies.

Default the GBox not have any varies, it means with it will return the same cached results for all users.

Declaring varies
-------------

The GBox use [Caddyfile syntax](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/concepts#structure) to declaring varies, you can declare varies based on the header and/or cookie of your users use to authenticate via `GBOX_CACHING_VARIES` environment variable.

Caddy varies directives:

| Name    | Description          |
|---------|----------------------|
| headers | List of header names |
| cookies | List of cookie names |


```yaml
GBOX_CACHING_VARIES: |
    authenticated { # varies name it can be anything.
        headers Authorization
        cookies session_id
    }
```

:::note
Header names are case-insensitive, cookie names are case-sensitive.
:::

Using varies
------------

To set varies a certain query result should be cached by, create a cache rule for the types you want to cache separately per-user (see cache [Rules](./01-rules.mdx) for more information):

```yaml
GBOX_CACHING_RULES: |
    users { # varies name it can be anything.
        max_age 30m
        swr 30m
        varies authorization
    }
```

Now every query result will be cached with the corresponding cookie and/or header of the `authenticated` varies and will only be returned for the same user. Users that aren't authenticated will still get the same cached results.
