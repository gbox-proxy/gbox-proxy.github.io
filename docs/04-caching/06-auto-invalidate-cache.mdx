It's a powerful feature help to purge cached query results through mutation operations responses.

For example, imagine this GraphQL schema:

```graphql
type Book {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}

type Mutation {
  updateBook: Book!
}
```

and the following mutation query:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateBook {
    id
  }
}
```

Once the mutation completes, any cached query results that contain the `Book` with the returned ID will be invalidated.

:::note
Auto invalidate cache feature **does not** automatically invalidate data is when items are added to a list,
you can use admin API to [purge via specific type](./05-admin-api.mdx#api-purge-via-specific-type).
:::

This feature enabled by default. If you want to disable it, set value of `GBOX_AUTO_INVALIDATE_CACHE` environment variable to `false`.
