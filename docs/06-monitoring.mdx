[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is a monitoring platform that collects metrics from monitored targets by scraping metrics HTTP endpoints on these targets.
As well as helping you to display metrics with a dashboard tool like [Grafana](https://grafana.io), Prometheus is also used for [alerting](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/overview/).

The GBox emit metrics help you to monitor GraphQL operation durations, total operation in flight and caching statues. In additional, GBox is a custom build of [the Caddy web server](https://caddyserver.com) including the `http.handlers.gbox` module,
so it has all [Caddy metrics](https://caddyserver.com/docs/metrics#caddys-metrics).

Enable metrics endpoint
-----------------------

Metrics endpoint disabled by default, to enable it, you need to set `GBOX_ENABLED_METRICS` environment variable to `true`.

By default, metrics endpoint's `/metrics`, if you want to change it, try to set `GBOX_METRICS_PATH` environment variable.

### caddy_http_gbox_operations_in_flight

A gauge of the number of operations currently being handled by this server.

| Label          | Description                                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| operation_name | GraphQL query operation name                               |
| operation_type | GraphQL query operation type (query/mutation/subscription) |

### caddy_http_gbox_operation_total

A counter of GraphQL query operations made.

| Label          | Description                                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| operation_name | GraphQL query operation name                               |
| operation_type | GraphQL query operation type (query/mutation/subscription) |

### caddy_http_gbox_operation_duration

A histogram of the GraphQL query operations durations.

The buckets are currently not configurable. The default [prometheus.DefBuckets](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#pkg-variables)
set of buckets is used (5ms, 10ms, 25ms, 50ms, 100ms, 250ms, 500ms, 1s, 2.5s, 5s, and 10s).

|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| operation_name | GraphQL query operation name                               |
| operation_type | GraphQL query operation type (query/mutation/subscription) |

### caddy_http_gbox_caching_total

A counter of GraphQL query operations caching statues.

| Label          | Description                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| operation_name | GraphQL query operation name                                |
| status         | Cache statuses of GraphQL query operations  (HIT/MISS/PASS) |
