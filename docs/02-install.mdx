You can install the pre-compiled binary, use Docker, or use Helm chart for Kubernetes.

Below you can find the steps for each of them.

Pre-compiled binary
-------------------

GBox is available as a custom build of [the Caddy web server](https://caddyserver.com) including the `http.handlers.gbox` module.

First, download the archive corresponding to your operating system and architecture [from the release page](https://github.com/gbox-proxy/gbox/releases), extract the archive and open a shell in the resulting directory.

:::tip
Mac OS users must use the Darwin binary.
:::

On Linux and Mac OS X, run:

```shell
GBOX_UPSTREAM='graphql_url_endpoint'
./gbox run -config ./Caddyfile.dist
```

On Windows, start PowerShell and run:

```shell
$env:GBOX_UPSTREAM='graphql_url_endpoint'; .\gbox.exe run Caddyfile.dist
```

:::info
Remember to change value of GBOX_UPSTREAM env.
:::

GBox is now available on [https://localhost](https://localhost).

GraphQL API endpoint's `/graphql`.

Running with Docker
-------------------

You can also use it within a Docker container. To do that, you'll need to execute something more-or-less like the examples below:

```shell
docker run \
    -e GBOX_UPSTREAM='graphql_url_endpoint' \
    -p 80:80 \
    -p 443:443 \
    gboxproxy/gbox
```

Or you can use Docker compose setting below:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  gbox:
    image: gboxproxy/gbox
    environment:
      GBOX_UPSTREAM: 'graphql_url_endpoint'
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
```

GBox is now available on [https://localhost](https://localhost).

Helm chart for Kubernetes
-------------------------

Use the [Helm package manager](https://helm.sh) to install GBox on a Kubernetes cluster:

To install the chart with the release name my-release, run the following commands:

```shell
helm repo add gbox https://gbox-proxy.github.io/gbox
helm upgrade my-release gbox/gbox -i --set upstream='graphql_url_endpoint'
```

See [the list of available values](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/gbox/gbox) for this chart.
